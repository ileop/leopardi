# Business Development Study: Feasibility of visual technologies in the market of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems for road security
* Jan 2018 – May 2018
* _KTH, EIT Digital Media Technology_ 

## Abstract
This research investigates the relevance of camera-based technologies within Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for the automotive industry. With camera-based it is meant the ensemble of visual technologies – systems making usage of images – employing camera in the acquisition process.
Road traffic security represents a relevant segment for the automotive industry, carrying technical innovations and important investments; ADAS is a main part of such sector. Therefore, the adoption of visual technology, and in particular camera-based ones, is studied for its relative worth in ADAS applications as well as for near-future developments as Automated Vehicles (AVs) whose interest is rising attention from the market.

My contribution is the study of the value that visual technologies provides to the market of automotive safety in the short-mid term period.
