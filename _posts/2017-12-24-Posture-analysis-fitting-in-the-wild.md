# Posture analysis through _“fitting-in-the-wild”_ based technique
* Jul 2017 – Dec 2017
* _UniTN, EIT Digital Media Technology_

## Summary
This project aims to evaluate the goodness of a user's posture when it is sat in front of its laptop. The evaluation compares two real-time approaches in terms of precision and computational efforts. Both the methods employ an **Active Appearance Model (AAM)** technique for facial elements detection, considering them as a major indicator for the whole posture. Two different AAM implementations have been considered to better achieve the specific characteristics of each method.
